# paraPropPython

this is a simple, in-ice parabolic equation EM solver. It uses the parabolic equation approximation to simulate the propagation of EM waves in a medium with a changing index of refraction. 

Currently it is designed to simulate propagation of waves beneath the ice and in the air on ~1km baselines. 

The simulation is highly customizable. The user can specify a source and an index of refraction profile in several different ways. Information on how to use this software can be found in the examples and the .py files. 

both steady state (continuous-wave) sources and time-domain sources can be simulated.

## installing

no installation, just clone the repo

## using

To begin, take a look at the ```example.ipynb``` jupyter notebook. ```example_td.ipynb``` is another example notebook showing the time-domain capabilities.
